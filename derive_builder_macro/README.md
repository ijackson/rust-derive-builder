# Crate [`derive_builder_macro`]

**Important Note**:

* You are probably looking for the [`derive_builder`] crate,
  which wraps this crate and is much more ergonomic to use.

## **THIS IS A FORK**

This version of `derive_builder` has an additional `sub_builder` feature,
which [has not been accepted upstream](https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/issues/254).
We may add further additional features.

In other respects, this fork is likely to lag behind the upstream crate.

## Purpose

This is an internal helper library of [`derive_builder`].
